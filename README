Pomodroid Trac edition is a Java/Android application that interacts with a Trac
system, retrieves developerâ€™s tasks and lets him work following the 
basic rules of the Pomodoro technique. Pomodroid focuses on basic 
features of the technique. It does not focus on advanced techniques,
such as the prediction of the number of Pomodoros needed for an activity.

Initial reading
===============

Pomodroid is for any Android device using Android >= 1.6.
It has been tested on a Nexus One phone. The source code contains all
the needed dependencies, which are:
 * Android-xmlrpc (http://code.google.com/p/android-xmlrpc/), modified 
   to suits our needs
 * Db40 (http://db4o.com), used instead of SQLite, for playing with an
   object-oriented database

Trac
===============

Right now it is only possible to download issues from Trac
systems that _must_ have/use:
 * XML-RPC plugin (http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/XmlRpcPlugin) installed
 * HTTP BASIC AUTH access (may either be on HTTP or HTTPS) on /xmlrpc
   location

OpenPomo (once known as Pomodroid) is a simple Java/Android application that implements the
basic rules of the Pomodoro technique. OpenPomo focuses on basic
features of the technique. It does not focus on advanced techniques,
such as the prediction of the number of Pomodoros needed for an activity.

Initial reading
===============

OpenPomo is for any Android device using Android >= 1.6.
It has been tested on a Nexus One phone and on a Motorla Atrix. The source code contains all
the needed dependencies, which are:
 * Android-xmlrpc (http://code.google.com/p/android-xmlrpc/), modified 
   to suits our needs
 * Db40 (http://db4o.com), used instead of SQLite, for playing with an
   object-oriented database
